The files found here are copies of the Unicode files found on the Unicode
website. We only include the few files that we parse. When a new version
of Unicode comes out, we should be able to just replace those files and
parse the new version. Also, we parse at installation time, so we can
update an existing installation with a simple `apt-get upgrade`.

See: https://www.unicode.org/Public/

Select a version and then `ucd`.
