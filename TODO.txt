* `utf8lint` verify that a file is valid UTF-8 (see show-utf8, we can have a softlink instead).
* Enhance `show-utf8`:
  - Support a range (so we can see the characters in a given range).
  - Actually do a validation step.
* Add a reverse() function which works correctly with a UTF-8 string.
* Add a reverse() function which works correctly with a UTF-16 string.
* Add a fix() function which takes UTF-32/16 and removes any invalid characters (UTF-8 is done).
