/** \file
 * \brief The declarations of the UTF-8 library base functions.
 *
 * The functions defined in this file are used to do the actual conversions.
 *
 * They may be useful to you which is why we make them available here.
 * However, these are considered low level functions and you may want
 * to restrain using them. Using the `std::string`-base functions is
 * much safer and what is expected of you.
