libutf8 (1.0.1.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Implemented the to and from UTF-8 and UTF-16 encoding.
  * Fixed the u8casecmp() test function which would test 0xD800 to 0xDFFF
    as valid characters.
  * Added a new exception so we can distinguish whether an encoding or a
    decoding went wrong.
  * Optimized the UTF-32 to UTF-8 conversion, i.e. code bytes under 0x80 get
    copied as is.
  * Fixed the '\0' conversion, it would not get added to the output string.
  * Added a to_u8string() from a char32_t so we get an std::string as output.
  * Generate errors when the mbstowc() or wctombs() functions fail.
